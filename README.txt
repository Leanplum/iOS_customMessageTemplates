In this sample we show how to customize Leanplum In-App messages.

The built-in in-app messaging templates are open-source. You can modify them, delete them, or create your own. The dashboard will reflect your new templates the next time you run your app. 

Once the Messages are created or customized, they can be synced with the Leanplum Dashboard just like Variables, running the app in Development mode and registering the device as a Test Device in the Dashboard.
